        <p>
           Hey Temidun🤍,
        <br><br>
        I honestly don’t even know where to start — you’ve been such a light in my life. 😶 hehehehe
        From our random talks to the times we laughed till our stomachs hurt, you’ve been a constant reminder of what real friendship feels like.  
        <br><br>
        This site is my little gift to you — nothing fancy, but made straight from the heart.  
        Every song here reminds me of you in one way or another — the energy you bring, the chaos we laugh through, and the calm that comes with just knowing you’re around.  
        <br><br>
        I wanted to make something that lasts — something you can open later and smile at.  
        This playlist holds pieces of what I love about us, and about you — your kindness, your warmth, and yes, your beautiful chaos 😆.  
        <br><br>
        I don’t say it enough, but I’m genuinely proud of you — for how you handle life, how you care for people, and how you keep showing up even when things get tough.  
        <br><br>
        I hope this small space makes you smile today. You deserve all the love in the world.  
        Never forget how loved you are — not just today, but every day.  
        <br><br>
        — Love, Ella 💜
